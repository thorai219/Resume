          <p>This is a website with two apps. One is where you can find popular repositories of GitHub based on
            programminglanguages. Another app is to enter in two people's GitHub account and have a battle with
            eachother.
            The outcome of the battle is determined with how many repos/stars/followers they have.
            This is built with React and from Tyler Mcginnis React Course.</p>

          <p>Luna tutor was created for the 2020 NASA SpaceApps Challenge in Seattle.
            This was made by 4 members of my cohorts.
            With teachers not as accessible as they are able to be inside a classroom,
            we feared that students were in need of an additional place to ask their science-related questions. This is
            what inspired us to create lunatutor,
            a space where anyone can ask and answer questions relating to science.</p>

          <p>Hello, my name is Seung Lee. I am having a career transition to software development from being a chef
            for10 years. Iâ€™ve worked at various restaurants, and I have run my own sushi bar. Always with a can-do mind,
            diligently worked hard and learned to survive in a highly competitive industry. Running a
            business comes with many responsibilities and I've wore many hats.
            I have learned and tried many different things,
            but was fascinated by many softwares that helped me get more things done faster.
            Currently, I am looking to work for tech companies related to the hospitality industry where I can utilize
            my experience. Running my own restaurant was a big challenge for me and I am seeking more challenges in the
            software development scene.</p>
